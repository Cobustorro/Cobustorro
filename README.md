# 👋 Hi, I'm Mark!

I am a Renewable Energy Project Manager with international experience delivering multi-MW solar power plant projects, coordinating construction activities, and managing engineering documentation.

I am now shifting my career toward Cybersecurity and GRC, building on the analytical, operational, and technical strengths developed throughout my engineering and project management background.
Over the past year, I have been deeply upskilling through hands-on labs, formal training, and self-hosted environments to prepare for a full transition into the security field.

## 💻 My Technical & Cybersecurity Foundation

I am developing practical, job-ready skills in areas such as:

- **Security Analysis & Monitoring:**  
  Log analysis, SIEM tooling (Wazuh, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel), network traffic investigation (Wireshark, Suricata, Zeek)

- **Systems & Identity:**  
  Linux administration, Windows Server, Active Directory, Microsoft 365, Azure AD

- **Automation:**  
  Security automation and enrichment workflows using Python, Bash, SQL, Shuffle SOAR

- **Governance & Compliance:**  
  ISO 27001, RODO/GDPR, risk analysis, documentation workflows

I strengthen these skills through **self-hosted homelabs**, **cloud-based environments**, and **structured certification paths**.

### 🛠️ Key Hands-on Projects

I've developed and implemented hands-on solutions demonstrating enterprise-ready security practices:

#### 1. [SOC Automation & Incident Response Pipeline](https://github.com/Cobustorro/SOC-Automation-Project)

Built a functional SOC environment integrating SIEM, SOAR (Shuffle), and case management (TheHive).
* Configured Wazuh with Sysmon for endpoint monitoring and created custom detection rules0].
* Built SOAR workflows to automate enrichment (VirusTotal) and forward alerts].
* Implemented an analyst-approved containment action that blocks malicious IPs using Wazuh active response2].

#### 2. Active Directory Security & Automated Account Containment ## Uploading is in progress

Developed an enterprise-like AD lab integrated with Splunk and automation].
* Built detections for unauthorized logins and RDP access anomalies].
* Integrated SOAR workflows to automatically disable compromised AD accounts on approval.

#### 3. Cloud & Endpoint Security ## Uploading is in progress

Deployed a Microsoft 35 developer environment and connected endpoints to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
* Practiced Sentinel queries (KQL) to investigate authentication anomalies and cloud activity logs2.
